    "# Create a LangChain AI Agent in Python with watsonx \n",
    "\n",
    "**Author**: Anna Gutowska \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use the LangChain Python package to build an AI agent that utilizes its custom tools to return a URL directing to [NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "An [artificial intelligence (AI) agent](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-agents), otherwise known as a [Large Language Model (LLM)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models) agent, is a system that performs tasks on behalf of a user or another system by designing its own workflow and utilizing available tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Overview of AI agents \n",
    "One of the most common modalities of agentic AI approaches are chatbots. However, agentic technology can encompass a wide range of functions. These include planning, problem-solving, interacting with external environments, and executing actions. These agents can be deployed to solve complex tasks in various enterprise contexts. From software design and IT automation, including customer service bots, to code-generation tools and conversational AI assistants, AI agents leverage the capability of LLMs to work step-by-step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key processes that make AI agents unique in their autonomy are: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Goal initializaiton and planning**. Although AI agents are autonomous in their planning of future actions, they require goals and environments defined by humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reasoning using available tools**. An AI agent’s plan of action is based on the information it perceives, or its percepts. Often, AI agents do not have the full knowledge base needed for tackling all subtasks within a complex goal. To remedy this, AI agents use their available tools. These tools can include external datasets, algorithms, search tools, APIs and even other agents. We can give agents instructions to first \"think\" and plan their response before deciding which tools to use and iteratively improving the response, if needed. This can be done by aligning the predefined prompt structure with a ReAct (Reasoning and Action) framework. The ReAct prompting technique essentially tells the agent to reason slowly and to display each \"thought\". The verbal reasoning produced gives insight into how responses are being formulated. On the contrary, planning is not a necessary step for an agent when working on simple tasks. Instead, an agent can iteratively reflect on its responses and improve them without planning its next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Learning and reflection**. AI agents use feedback mechanisms, such as other AI agents and human-in-the-loop (HITL), to improve the accuracy of their responses. \n",
    "\n",
    " Traditional LLMs, like the IBM [Granite Model](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai/foundation-models) we will be using in this tutorial, produce their responses based on the data used to train them. There is a knowledge and reasoning limitation. This means that current information, such as today's date, is not available to the model without any additional tools. In contrast, agentic technology utilizes tool calling on the backend to obtain up-to-date information, optimize workflow, and create specific tasks autonomously to achieve complex goals. In this process, the autonomous agent is learning to adapt to user expectations over time, providing a  personalized experience and comprehensive responses. This tool calling can be achieved without human intervention and broadens the possibilities for real-world applications of these AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "We encourage you to check out our [AI Agents article](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-agents) for more in-depth information on the various AI agent architectures and their abstractions. \n",

Check out the image [here](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2407/GianniTumino_Etna&MW_14mm_JPG_LOGO__1024pix.jpg \"here\"). Since we wanted to see the image  from today, the agent used the `get_todays_date` tool first in order to then use that date for the `get_astronomy_image` tool. Additionally, the agent is successfully updating its knowledge base as it learns new information and experiences new interactions as seen by the history output. \n",

    "The sample output is important as it shows the steps the agent took in creating its own agent workflow using available tools. In our case, the LLM on its own was not able to achieve the first subtask of the problem - finding the current date. Hence, the tools granted to the agent were incredibly useful and vital for achieving the goal. \n",
